Ever wanted to take a screenshot of some code to share on /<insert IM platform
of choice here>/?
+ Yes: well then this package may just be for you!
+ No: you're lying

[[file:screenshot.png]]

With this package you can trivially convert a selected region of code to a
screenshot (no fiddly cropping required), with nothing but Emacs itself.

If you add in ~xclip~, this will happily copy a screenshot straight to your
clipboard. Provide ~imagemagick~ too and you can get rounded borders and a drop
shadow ðŸ˜‰.
